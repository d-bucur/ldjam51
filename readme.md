## 🎯 Description

A race against the clock, literally! **Protect** the extractors that are warping in by carefully **repositioning** enemies and other objects on the field. The clock hand does a full rotation every 10 seconds and will trigger objects when it touches them.

I didn't manage to implement proper high scores so feel free to share your high score in the comments.

## 🎮 Controls

- WASD/Arrow keys/Left analog stick to move

- SPACE/CTRL/Btn A to drag objects

*Note*: Plays better with a gamepad
