- different enemy types
  - charger. how is it as strong as shooter?
  - melee. always follows you and kills stuff in front of it
  - shooter. projectile but always follows you
  - lancer. static but firest hitscan laser
- powerup types:
- - **shield**: blocks a few shots before breaking
  - mirror: duplicates the shot in new directions

## juice
- **bug when enemies rotate**
- more animations
  - particles on cannon death
  - explosion animation

## ideas to explore
- player interaction with trigger
- projectiles split when time triggered
- second lance that duplicates stuff
- reposition enemies after triggering
- kill enemies when falling off level
